# wordlist_mod v1.0 Help File

# Description:
This python script performs a number of user defined actions which clean/edit a provided wordlist used in dictionary based password cracking.  The input is a wordlist (dictionary) and the output is the modified wordlist based on the userâ€™s selected actions. 

# Why is this program needed?:
Information security practioners and penetration testers generally test authentication systems by attempting to use default or previously compromised credentials.  Many wordlists found on the open Internet contain common passwords or those exposed in seperate breach.  Use of the wordlists provices the tester a means of knowing if weak or previously compromosied passwords are used on the authenticaiton system.  This program is useful for modifying such wordlists to remove duplicate items, unncessary white space, or return only passwords of certain lenths.

This program should only be used to test authentication systems for which you own or have been givnen permission to test.
